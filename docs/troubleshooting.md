# Troubleshooting and Debugging

## Data Assumptions

- Synthetic dataset simulates flight reservations with realistic fields.  
- Airport codes are randomly selected from a valid list, with occasional invalid entries.  
- Passenger names are generated using the Faker library.  
- Fare values range from $100 to $1000, with some entries containing invalid types or missing values.  
- Status values include Confirmed, Cancelled, and Pending.  

---

## How Test Data Was Generated

- Used Python’s Faker library to create 200 reservation records.  
- Generated `PNR` as random 6-character alphanumeric codes.  
- Picked `Origin` and `Destination` from a mix of 10 valid IATA codes and a small set of invalid codes.  
- Assigned `Passenger` names from Faker’s first and last name methods, with intentional blanks to test missing data.  
- Produced `Fare` as floats between 100.00 and 1000.00, coercing ~5% of values to strings or nulls.  
- Randomly set `Status` to Confirmed, Cancelled, or Pending.  

---

## Edge Cases Introduced

- Missing `Fare` and `Passenger` fields to simulate incomplete data.  
- Duplicate records to test deduplication logic.  
- Invalid airport codes to test validation routines.  
- Incorrect data types in `Fare` to test type-checking and conversion logic.  
- Transient I/O errors simulated by throwing `OSError` on CSV export.

## Optimization Summary

### 1. Initial Metrics Collection with psutil and Logging

**Before**  
We began with no profiling or metrics collection, making it difficult to identify performance bottlenecks or memory issues.
```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def drop_duplicates(df):
    before = len(df)
    df = df.drop_duplicates(subset=["PNR"])
    removed = before - len(df)
    if removed:
        logger.info("Removed %d duplicate PNR records", removed)

    return df
```

**After**  
Before adding profiling, we instrumented key pipeline steps to log runtime, memory usage, row counts, and error rates using `psutil` and Python’s `logging` module.

```python
import logging

# Get a module-specific logger
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
def drop_duplicates(df):
    """
    Removes duplicate rows based on PNR and logs metrics:
      - rows before/after
      - execution time
      - memory delta
    """
    proc = psutil.Process()
    mem_before = proc.memory_info().rss
    t0 = time.perf_counter()

    before = len(df)
    df = df.drop_duplicates(subset=["PNR"])
    removed = before - len(df)
    if removed:
        logger.info("Removed %d duplicate PNR records", removed)

    t1 = time.perf_counter()
    mem_after = proc.memory_info().rss

    logger.info(
        "drop_duplicates metrics — rows_before: %d, rows_after: %d, time: %.3fs, Δmem: %.2f MB",
        before,len(df),t1 - t0,(mem_after - mem_before) / (1024**2))

    return df
```

| Step                 | Logging-Only Runtime | Logging+psutil Runtime | Δ Runtime | Logging-Only Peak Mem | Logging+psutil Peak Mem | Δ Mem   |
|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------|-----------|-----------------------|-------------------------|---------|

#### Performance Decisions

- We started with logging only, which gave us visibility into flow but no hard numbers on resource usage.

- Adding psutil allowed us to capture per-step memory peaks and precise runtimes with minimal code changes.

- The immediate overhead (2–5 % runtime, ~3–5 MB memory) is a worthwhile trade-off in an RPA pipeline. Actionable metrics quickly surface hotspots without requiring a full profiling run.

- Having coarse-grained metrics in logs means any future CI or alerting system can detect regressions automatically.

- Once we see a slow or memory-heavy step, we can drop into cProfile/Snakeviz for fine-grained analysis, confident we’re focusing on the true pain points.

### 2. Centralized Profiling (`cProfile` + `snakeviz`)
Each module duplicated its own profiler once created

**Before** (each module re-implemented profiling):  
```python
# services/transformer.py
import cProfile
import pstats

def profile(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        pr = cProfile.Profile()
        pr.enable()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        pr.disable()
        stats = pstats.Stats(pr)
        stats.dump_stats("profiles/transformer.prof")
        return result
    return wrapper

@profile
def transform_data(df):
    # conversion logic
    return df
```
**After** (shared decorator in services/profiler.py):  
```python
# services/profiler.py
import cProfile
import pstats
import io
import os
from datetime import datetime
from functools import wraps

def profile(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        pr = cProfile.Profile()
        pr.enable()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        pr.disable()
        os.makedirs("profiles", exist_ok=True)
        pr.dump_stats(f"profiles/{func.__name__}.prof")
        return result
    return wrapper
```

#### Runtime/Memory Comparison: Logging+psutil vs Profiling

| Step                 | Logging+psutil Runtime | Profiling Runtime | Δ Runtime | Logging+psutil Peak Mem | Profiling Peak Mem | Δ Mem |

| load_reservations    | 0.36 s                 | 0.44 s            | +22%      | 114 MB                  | 120 MB             | +6 MB |
| convert_fares        | 0.12 s                 | 0.15 s            | +25%      |  93 MB                  |  98 MB             | +5 MB |
| drop_duplicates      | 0.08 s                 | 0.10 s            | +25%      | 104 MB                  | 110 MB             | +6 MB |
| export_cleaned       | 0.21 s                 | 0.26 s            | +24%      | 125 MB                  | 132 MB             | +7 MB |

#### Profiling Performance Decisions

- After gathering coarse-grained metrics with psutil, we enabled cProfile for function-level timing and call counts.  
- cProfile adds significant overhead (~20–25% runtime, ~5–7 MB memory), so we would only turn it on during deep investigations instead of regular runs.  
- The detailed call statistics pinpoint exact hotspots. These are functions with high cumulative time or excessive call volume.  
- Visualizing profiles with Snakeviz’s flamegraphs and call trees accelerates root-cause analysis and guides targeted refactoring.  
- Armed with fine-grained data, we optimized key routines (e.g., vectorized nested loops, memoized expensive calculations) to deliver maximum impact for minimal effort.

## Reflection

The most challenging part of this assignment was striking the right balance between comprehensive observability and maintaining clean, readable code across five distinct service modules. I needed to capture meaningful metrics (runtime, memory usage, row counts, and error rates) without littering each file with boilerplate. Introducing psutil and logging first gave me immediate insights, but it laid bare how easy it was to inadvertently bloat the code. Later, when we moved to cProfile and Snakeviz integration, I had to ensure profiling was both efficient and non-intrusive. Centralizing the `@profile` decorator in a single `services/profiler.py` module required careful refactoring so that each script simply imported one function and nothing more.

Copilot proved invaluable in sketching out initial code templates for timing and memory capture. It suggested the high-level use of psutil and provided starter snippets for decorators and retry logic. However, I often needed to correct and refine those suggestions. For example, adjusting the decorator wraps, ensuring absolute file paths for `.prof` dumps, and handling edge cases like idempotent CSV exports. When Copilot’s output lacked context, like missing directory creation or proper exception handling, I stepped in to inject robust error checks and logging formats that aligned with the existing patterns.

Through this process, I learned that debugging and optimization are as much about developer ergonomics as raw performance gains. Lightweight metrics via psutil quickly highlight hotspots, but deeper profiling with cProfile and visualization tools like Snakeviz reveal nuanced call-graph insights. I discovered the power of in-place operations in pandas to reduce memory spikes and the necessity of exponential backoff for flaky I/O. The best optimizations emerged when observability drove targeted, data-informed refactoring rather than blind guessing.
